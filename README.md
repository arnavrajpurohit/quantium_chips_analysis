## Task 1: Data Cleaning & Customer Analytics

In this task, we cleaned and explored customer and transaction data to identify trends in chip purchasing behavior. Key steps included:

- Merging transaction and customer datasets
- Extracting features like brand and pack size
- Identifying top-performing customer segments based on:
  - Lifestage
  - Premium vs Budget customer classification
- Exploring product sales distribution and spending behavior

**Output:** Cleaned dataset (`merged_data.csv`), customer insights, and visuals

## Task 2: Trial vs Control Store Performance Analysis

We evaluated the impact of a trial marketing campaign run in Stores 77, 86, and 88. Key actions:

- Selected control stores based on sales, customers, and transactions
- Used statistical and visual comparisons (e.g., line charts, t-tests)
- Assessed trial outcomes across three KPIs:
  - Total sales revenue
  - Total number of customers
  - Average number of transactions per customer

**Output:** Control store pairings, trial uplift plots, and significance tests

## Task 3: Executive Report & Strategic Recommendation

We compiled findings from Tasks 1 and 2 into a client-ready PowerPoint report. This report follows the Pyramid Principle and includes:

- Executive summary of key insights
- Category analysis of spending trends by customer group
- Trial performance outcomes with visual evidence
- Final recommendation on trial success and scalability

**Output:** `final_presentation.pdf` (PowerPoint exported to PDF)

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Excel (optional for charting)
- PowerPoint (final report formatting)

## Summary

This end-to-end project demonstrates a practical application of data cleaning, customer segmentation, A/B trial evaluation, and stakeholder communication â€” simulating the hybrid analyst-consultant role typical at Quantium.
